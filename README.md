# Pizza Py

**Pizza Py is currently in alpha stage and is actively in development. If you are interested in joining the dev team please reach out!**

Pizza Py is intended to be a comprehensive framework for rapid development of http api's using the python language. Pizza Py is built on top of the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) framework and utilizes [PyPi waitress](https://pypi.org/project/waitress/) & [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to provide a simple interface to deploy code to production! Pizza Py is heavily influenced by the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework and strives to bring the same comprehensive & intuitive design found in the [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/) to the python dev community. The work done by the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) team is astounding and you should absolutely check them out!
